# cool-links-for-cybersecurity
A page containing my bookmarks on my journey to learning cyber.

## Learning Platforms
### OverTheWire
https://overthewire.org/wargames/ - one of the first links I ever clicked on when I first became curious about hacking. Can't recommend this enough. Start with band1t and you'll learn command line basics in a fun way. Move on to the harder ones next. Old school is cool.

### HackThisSite
https://www.hackthissite.org/ - Another old school hacking training website. If you want to bring back 2005 vibes this is the place to be.

### TryHackMe
https://tryhackme.com/ - Very beginner friendly CTF website. Some free content. Premium content is affordable. Expect your hand to be held while we spoon feed you tidbits of information that will help you on your hacker journey. If you're looking for something a bit more challenging try:

### HackTheBox
https://www.hackthebox.com/
Or:

### Root-Me
https://www.root-me.org/?lang=en I should probably mention root-me since I've mentioned HTB and THM. However, I have found this website to be a bit unuserfriendly always changing the language to french without asking my permission.
