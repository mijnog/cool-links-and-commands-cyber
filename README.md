These platforms are great starting points and resources to build your cybersecurity knowledge and hacking skills.

- #### [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/)

- #### [HackThisSite](https://www.hackthissite.org/)
  Another old-school hacking training site. Great if you want to bring back 2005 vibes!

- #### [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/)
  Beginner-friendly CTF website with free and affordable premium content. *Hand-holding* included, so it's perfect for newcomers. For something more challenging, try:

- #### [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com/)
  Known for providing a more challenging environment with hands-on labs for hacking skills.

- #### [Root-Me](https://www.root-me.org/?lang=en)
  Root-Me is a well-known platform but can be tricky to navigate due to language settings automatically switching to French.
